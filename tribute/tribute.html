      <strong> <h2>About the legend</h2></strong>
      <p><span>&#x1F449;</span> Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was a polymath from India who made significant contributions to literature, music, and art.  </p>
      <p><span>&#x1F449;</span> He was the first non-European to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his collection of poems titled "Gitanjali" (Song Offerings).</p>
      <p><span>&#x1F449;</span>Tagore's works transcend conventional genres and include poetry, short stories, novels, essays, and plays.</p>
      <p><span>&#x1F449;</span>Tagore was also a philosopher and a social reformer. He emphasized the importance of education and founded the Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, which aimed to combine the best elements of Western and Indian education.</p>
      <p><span>&#x1F449;</span>Tagore was deeply involved in the Indian independence movement and used his writings to promote the ideals of humanism, internationalism, and freedom. </p>
      <p><span>&#x1F449;</span>He composed the song "Jana Gana Mana," which later became the national anthem of India, and also wrote "Amar Sonar Bangla," which is the national anthem of Bangladesh.</p>
